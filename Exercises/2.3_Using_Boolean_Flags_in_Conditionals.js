// The Flappy National Park would like to print specific messages depending
// on whether the park is open or closed.
//
// Theyâ€™ve asked you to modify their code to print one of the following
// messages depending on the boolean value (true or false) of the variable
// parkIsOpen.
//
// Add a pair of conditional statements to print one of the following messages
// to the console based on the parkIsOpen variable:
//
//    "Welcome to the Flappy National Park! Try to enjoy your stay."
// OR
//
//    "Sorry, Flappy needs some maintenance work. We're closed!"
//
// Use the code below in your solution.
